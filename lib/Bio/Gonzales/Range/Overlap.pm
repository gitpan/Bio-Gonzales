=head1 NAME

Bio::Gonzales::Range::Overlap - find overlapping ranges

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use 5.010;
  use Bio::Gonzales::Range::Overlap;
  use Data::Dumper;

  my @ranges1 = (
    [ 0, 5, 'some', 'information' ],
    [ 6, 8,  'some',     'other', 'information' ],
    [ 7, 10, 'nonsense', 'information' ],
    [ 11, 100, { 'very' => 'complicated', "data" => 'structure' } ],
  );

  my $ro = Bio::Gonzales::Range::Overlap->new;

  #build query db from 1st set of intervals
  for my $r (@ranges1) {
    $ro->insert(@$r);
  }

  # in this case (from and to are elements 0 and 1)
  # insert could be called with all ranges
  #$ro->insert(\@ranges1);

  my @ranges2 = ( [ 8, 10 ], [ 1, 3 ], [99,200],);

  # query the db with ranges
  for my $r (@ranges2) {
    say "Range (" . join(",", @$r) . ") overlaps with:";
    say Dumper $ro->overlaps_with(@$r);
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<@range> has the form C<($from, $to, @additional elements)>. Lists of
ranges have the form C<([$from, $to, @add_elems], [$from, $to, @add_elems], ...)>.
